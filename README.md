# DBApi
 This is a basic API using Spring Boot that can access MongoDB. 
 
 To run this code you need Java 11 and IntelliJ IDEA. 
 Import the project in IDEA and select the run configuration to be Spring Boot application. If there are issues running the project contact Kyr. You might need to download a MongoDB driver inside of your project, however it should be in there already. Let Kyr know if you need help downloading the driver.
 Pelase note that this is a Gradle project, not Maven.

After the application is launched go to your web browser and try the following mapping: http://localhost:8080/api/placeDescriptions You should see a sample data JSON from the database.

Please let me know if there are any issues running.
